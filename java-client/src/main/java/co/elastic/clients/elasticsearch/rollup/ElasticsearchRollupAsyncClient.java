	 * <p>
	 * IMPORTANT: When you delete a job, you remove only the process that is

	 * static data set. Because the data set is static, after it has been fully

	 * up data for analysis. If you wish to also remove the rollup data and the
	 * rollup index contains the data for only a single job, you can delete the
	 * whole rollup index. If the rollup index stores data from several jobs, you

	/**
	 * Search rolled-up data. The rollup search endpoint is needed because,
	 * internally, rolled-up documents utilize a different document structure than
	 * the original data. It rewrites standard Query DSL into a format that matches
	 * the rollup documents then takes the response and rewrites it back to what a
	 * client would expect given the original query.
	 * <p>
	 * The request body supports a subset of features from the regular search API.
	 * The following functionality is not available:
	 * <p>
	 * <code>size</code>: Because rollups work on pre-aggregated data, no search
	 * hits can be returned and so size must be set to zero or omitted entirely.
	 * <code>highlighter</code>, <code>suggestors</code>, <code>post_filter</code>,
	 * <code>profile</code>, <code>explain</code>: These are similarly disallowed.
	 * <p>
	 * <strong>Searching both historical rollup and non-rollup data</strong>
	 * <p>
	 * The rollup search API has the capability to search across both
	 * &quot;live&quot; non-rollup data and the aggregated rollup data. This is done
	 * by simply adding the live indices to the URI. For example:
	 * 
	 * <pre>
	 * <code>GET sensor-1,sensor_rollup/_rollup_search
	 * {
	 *   &quot;size&quot;: 0,
	 *   &quot;aggregations&quot;: {
	 *      &quot;max_temperature&quot;: {
	 *       &quot;max&quot;: {
	 *         &quot;field&quot;: &quot;temperature&quot;
	 *       }
	 *     }
