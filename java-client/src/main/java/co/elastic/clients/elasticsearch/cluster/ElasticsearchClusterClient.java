	 * status of every shard copy in the cluster.
	 * <p>
	 * The elected master node ensures that every node in the cluster has a copy of
	 * the same cluster state. This API lets you retrieve a representation of this
	 * internal state for debugging or diagnostic purposes. You may need to consult
	 * the Elasticsearch source code to determine the precise meaning of the
	 * response.
	 * <p>
	 * By default the API will route requests to the elected master node since this
	 * node is the authoritative source of cluster states. You can also retrieve the
	 * cluster state held on the node handling the API request by adding the
	 * <code>?local=true</code> query parameter.
	 * <p>
	 * Elasticsearch may need to expend significant effort to compute a response to
	 * this API in larger clusters, and the response may comprise a very large
	 * quantity of data. If you use this API repeatedly, your cluster may become
	 * unstable.
	 * <p>
	 * WARNING: The response is a representation of an internal data structure. Its
	 * format is not subject to the same compatibility guarantees as other more
	 * stable APIs and may change from version to version. Do not query this API
	 * using external monitoring tools. Instead, obtain the information you require
	 * using other more stable cluster APIs.
