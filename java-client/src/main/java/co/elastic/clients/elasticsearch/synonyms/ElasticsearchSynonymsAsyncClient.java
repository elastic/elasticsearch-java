	 * Delete a synonym set.

	 * You can only delete a synonyms set that is not in use by any index analyzer.
	 * <p>
	 * Synonyms sets can be used in synonym graph token filters and synonym token
	 * filters. These synonym filters can be used as part of search analyzers.
	 * <p>
	 * Analyzers need to be loaded when an index is restored (such as when a node
	 * starts, or the index becomes open). Even if the analyzer is not used on any
	 * field mapping, it still needs to be loaded on the index recovery phase.
	 * <p>
	 * If any analyzers cannot be loaded, the index becomes unavailable and the
	 * cluster status becomes red or yellow as index shards are not available. To
	 * prevent that, synonyms sets that are used in analyzers can't be deleted. A
	 * delete request in this case will return a 400 response code.
	 * <p>
	 * To remove a synonyms set, you must first remove all indices that contain
	 * analyzers using it. You can migrate an index by creating a new index that
	 * does not contain the token filter with the synonyms set, and use the reindex
	 * API in order to copy over the index data. Once finished, you can delete the
	 * index. When the synonyms set is not used in analyzers, you will be able to
	 * delete it.
