	 * Index metadata includes aliases, index lifecycle management phase
	 * definitions, and cross-cluster replication (CCR) follower information. For
	 * example, if you clone a CCR follower index, the resulting clone will not be a

	 * <p>

	 * and <code>index.auto_expand_replicas</code>. To set the number of replicas in
	 * the resulting index, configure these settings in the clone request.
	 * <p>
	 * Cloning works as follows:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>First, it creates a new target index with the same definition as the
	 * source index.</li>
	 * <li>Then it hard-links segments from the source index into the target index.
	 * If the file system does not support hard-linking, all segments are copied
	 * into the new index, which is a much more time consuming process.</li>
	 * <li>Finally, it recovers the target index as though it were a closed index
	 * which had just been re-opened.</li>
	 * </ul>
	 * <p>
	 * IMPORTANT: Indices can only be cloned if they meet the following
	 * requirements:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>The index must be marked as read-only and have a cluster health status of
	 * green.</li>
	 * <li>The target index must not exist.</li>
	 * <li>The source index must have the same number of primary shards as the
	 * target index.</li>
	 * <li>The node handling the clone process must have sufficient free disk space
	 * to accommodate a second copy of the existing index.</li>
	 * </ul>
	 * <p>
	 * The current write index on a data stream cannot be cloned. In order to clone
	 * the current write index, the data stream must first be rolled over so that a
	 * new write index is created and then the previous write index can be cloned.
	 * <p>
	 * NOTE: Mappings cannot be specified in the <code>_clone</code> request. The
	 * mappings of the source index will be used for the target index.
	 * <p>
	 * <strong>Monitor the cloning process</strong>
	 * <p>
	 * The cloning process can be monitored with the cat recovery API or the cluster
	 * health API can be used to wait until all primary shards have been allocated
	 * by setting the <code>wait_for_status</code> parameter to <code>yellow</code>.
	 * <p>
	 * The <code>_clone</code> API returns as soon as the target index has been
	 * added to the cluster state, before any shards have been allocated. At this
	 * point, all shards are in the state unassigned. If, for any reason, the target
	 * index can't be allocated, its primary shard will remain unassigned until it
	 * can be allocated on that node.

	 * normally happens automatically, but sometimes it is useful to trigger a merge
	 * manually.
	 * <p>
	 * WARNING: We recommend force merging only a read-only index (meaning the index
	 * is no longer receiving writes). When documents are updated or deleted, the
	 * old version is not immediately removed but instead soft-deleted and marked
	 * with a &quot;tombstone&quot;. These soft-deleted documents are automatically
	 * cleaned up during regular segment merges. But force merge can cause very
	 * large (greater than 5 GB) segments to be produced, which are not eligible for
	 * regular merges. So the number of soft-deleted documents can then grow
	 * rapidly, resulting in higher disk usage and worse search performance. If you
	 * regularly force merge an index receiving writes, this can also make snapshots
	 * more expensive, since the new documents can't be backed up incrementally.
	 * <p>
	 * <strong>Blocks during a force merge</strong>
	 * <p>
	 * Calls to this API block until the merge is complete (unless request contains
	 * <code>wait_for_completion=false</code>). If the client connection is lost
	 * before completion then the force merge process will continue in the
	 * background. Any new requests to force merge the same indices will also block
	 * until the ongoing force merge is complete.
	 * <p>
	 * <strong>Running force merge asynchronously</strong>
	 * <p>
	 * If the request contains <code>wait_for_completion=false</code>, Elasticsearch
	 * performs some preflight checks, launches the request, and returns a task you
	 * can use to get the status of the task. However, you can not cancel this task
	 * as the force merge task is not cancelable. Elasticsearch creates a record of
	 * this task as a document at <code>_tasks/&lt;task_id&gt;</code>. When you are
	 * done with a task, you should delete the task document so Elasticsearch can
	 * reclaim the space.
	 * <p>
	 * <strong>Force merging multiple indices</strong>
	 * <p>
	 * You can force merge multiple indices with a single request by targeting:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>One or more data streams that contain multiple backing indices</li>
	 * <li>Multiple indices</li>
	 * <li>One or more aliases</li>
	 * <li>All data streams and indices in a cluster</li>
	 * </ul>
	 * <p>
	 * Each targeted shard is force-merged separately using the force_merge
	 * threadpool. By default each node only has a single <code>force_merge</code>
	 * thread which means that the shards on that node are force-merged one at a
	 * time. If you expand the <code>force_merge</code> threadpool on a node then it
	 * will force merge its shards in parallel
	 * <p>
	 * Force merge makes the storage for the shard being merged temporarily
	 * increase, as it may require free space up to triple its size in case
	 * <code>max_num_segments parameter</code> is set to <code>1</code>, to rewrite
	 * all segments into a new one.
	 * <p>

	 * <li>Whether there are any indices, aliases, or data streams on that cluster
	 * that match the index expression.</li>
	 * <li>Whether the search is likely to have errors returned when you do the
	 * cross-cluster search (including any authorization errors if you do not have
	 * permission to query the index).</li>
	 * <li>Cluster version information, including the Elasticsearch server
	 * version.</li>
	 * </ul>
	 * <p>
	 * For example,
	 * <code>GET /_resolve/cluster/my-index-*,cluster*:my-index-*</code> returns
	 * information about the local cluster and all remotely configured clusters that
	 * start with the alias <code>cluster*</code>. Each cluster returns information
	 * about whether it has any indices, aliases or data streams that match
	 * <code>my-index-*</code>.
	 * <h2>Note on backwards compatibility</h2>
	 * <p>
	 * The ability to query without an index expression was added in version 8.18,
	 * so when querying remote clusters older than that, the local cluster will send
	 * the index expression <code>dummy*</code> to those remote clusters. Thus, if
	 * an errors occur, you may see a reference to that index expression even though
	 * you didn't request it. If it causes a problem, you can instead include an
	 * index expression like <code>*:*</code> to bypass the issue.
	 * <h2>Advantages of using this endpoint before a cross-cluster search</h2>
	 * <p>
	 * You may want to exclude a cluster or index from a search when:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>A remote cluster is not currently connected and is configured with
	 * <code>skip_unavailable=false</code>. Running a cross-cluster search under
	 * those conditions will cause the entire search to fail.</li>
	 * <li>A cluster has no matching indices, aliases or data streams for the index
	 * expression (or your user does not have permissions to search them). For
	 * example, suppose your index expression is <code>logs*,remote1:logs*</code>
	 * and the remote1 cluster has no indices, aliases or data streams that match
	 * <code>logs*</code>. In that case, that cluster will return no results from
	 * that cluster if you include it in a cross-cluster search.</li>
	 * <li>The index expression (combined with any query parameters you specify)
	 * will likely cause an exception to be thrown when you do the search. In these
	 * cases, the &quot;error&quot; field in the <code>_resolve/cluster</code>
	 * response will be present. (This is also where security/permission errors will
	 * be shown.)</li>
	 * <li>A remote cluster is an older version that does not support the feature
	 * you want to use in your search.</li>
	 * </ul>
	 * <h2>Test availability of remote clusters</h2>
	 * <p>
	 * The <code>remote/info</code> endpoint is commonly used to test whether the
	 * &quot;local&quot; cluster (the cluster being queried) is connected to its
	 * remote clusters, but it does not necessarily reflect whether the remote
	 * cluster is available or not. The remote cluster may be available, while the
	 * local cluster is not currently connected to it.
	 * <p>
	 * You can use the <code>_resolve/cluster</code> API to attempt to reconnect to
	 * remote clusters. For example with <code>GET _resolve/cluster</code> or
	 * <code>GET _resolve/cluster/*:*</code>. The <code>connected</code> field in
	 * the response will indicate whether it was successful. If a connection was
	 * (re-)established, this will also cause the <code>remote/info</code> endpoint
	 * to now indicate a connected status.

	 * <p>
	 * The rollover API creates a new index for a data stream or index alias. The
	 * API behavior depends on the rollover target.
	 * <p>
	 * <strong>Roll over a data stream</strong>
	 * <p>
	 * If you roll over a data stream, the API creates a new write index for the
	 * stream. The stream's previous write index becomes a regular backing index. A
	 * rollover also increments the data stream's generation.
	 * <p>
	 * <strong>Roll over an index alias with a write index</strong>
	 * <p>
	 * TIP: Prior to Elasticsearch 7.9, you'd typically use an index alias with a
	 * write index to manage time series data. Data streams replace this
	 * functionality, require less maintenance, and automatically integrate with
	 * data tiers.
	 * <p>
	 * If an index alias points to multiple indices, one of the indices must be a
	 * write index. The rollover API creates a new write index for the alias with
	 * <code>is_write_index</code> set to <code>true</code>. The API also
	 * <code>sets is_write_index</code> to <code>false</code> for the previous write
	 * index.
	 * <p>
	 * <strong>Roll over an index alias with one index</strong>
	 * <p>
	 * If you roll over an index alias that points to only one index, the API
	 * creates a new index for the alias and removes the original index from the
	 * alias.
	 * <p>
	 * NOTE: A rollover creates a new index and is subject to the
	 * <code>wait_for_active_shards</code> setting.
	 * <p>
	 * <strong>Increment index names for an alias</strong>
	 * <p>
	 * When you roll over an index alias, you can specify a name for the new index.
	 * If you don't specify a name and the current index ends with <code>-</code>
	 * and a number, such as <code>my-index-000001</code> or
	 * <code>my-index-3</code>, the new index name increments that number. For
	 * example, if you roll over an alias with a current index of
	 * <code>my-index-000001</code>, the rollover creates a new index named
	 * <code>my-index-000002</code>. This number is always six characters and
	 * zero-padded, regardless of the previous index's name.
	 * <p>
	 * If you use an index alias for time series data, you can use date math in the
	 * index name to track the rollover date. For example, you can create an alias
	 * that points to an index named <code>&lt;my-index-{now/d}-000001&gt;</code>.
	 * If you create the index on May 6, 2099, the index's name is

	 * Split an index. Split an index into a new index with more primary shards.
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>
	 * <p>
	 * Before you can split an index:
	 * </p>
	 * </li>
	 * <li>
	 * <p>
	 * The index must be read-only.
	 * </p>
	 * </li>
	 * <li>
	 * <p>
	 * The cluster health status must be green.
	 * </p>
	 * </li>
	 * </ul>
	 * <p>
	 * You can do make an index read-only with the following request using the add
	 * index block API:
	 * 
	 * <pre>
	 * <code>PUT /my_source_index/_block/write
	 * </code>
	 * </pre>
	 * <p>
	 * The current write index on a data stream cannot be split. In order to split
	 * the current write index, the data stream must first be rolled over so that a
	 * new write index is created and then the previous write index can be split.
	 * <p>
	 * The number of times the index can be split (and the number of shards that
	 * each original shard can be split into) is determined by the
	 * <code>index.number_of_routing_shards</code> setting. The number of routing
	 * shards specifies the hashing space that is used internally to distribute
	 * documents across shards with consistent hashing. For instance, a 5 shard
	 * index with <code>number_of_routing_shards</code> set to 30 (5 x 2 x 3) could
	 * be split by a factor of 2 or 3.
	 * <p>
	 * A split operation:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>Creates a new target index with the same definition as the source index,
	 * but with a larger number of primary shards.</li>
	 * <li>Hard-links segments from the source index into the target index. If the
	 * file system doesn't support hard-linking, all segments are copied into the
	 * new index, which is a much more time consuming process.</li>
	 * <li>Hashes all documents again, after low level files are created, to delete
	 * documents that belong to a different shard.</li>
	 * <li>Recovers the target index as though it were a closed index which had just
	 * been re-opened.</li>
	 * </ul>
	 * <p>
	 * IMPORTANT: Indices can only be split if they satisfy the following
	 * requirements:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>The target index must not exist.</li>
	 * <li>The source index must have fewer primary shards than the target
	 * index.</li>
	 * <li>The number of primary shards in the target index must be a multiple of
	 * the number of primary shards in the source index.</li>
	 * <li>The node handling the split process must have sufficient free disk space
