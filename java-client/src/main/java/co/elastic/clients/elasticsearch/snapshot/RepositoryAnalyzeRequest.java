/**
 * Analyze a snapshot repository. Analyze the performance characteristics and
 * any incorrect behaviour found in a repository.
 * <p>
 * The response exposes implementation details of the analysis which may change
 * from version to version. The response body format is therefore not considered
 * stable and may be different in newer versions.
 * <p>
 * There are a large number of third-party storage systems available, not all of
 * which are suitable for use as a snapshot repository by Elasticsearch. Some
 * storage systems behave incorrectly, or perform poorly, especially when
 * accessed concurrently by multiple clients as the nodes of an Elasticsearch
 * cluster do. This API performs a collection of read and write operations on
 * your repository which are designed to detect incorrect behaviour and to
 * measure the performance characteristics of your storage system.
 * <p>
 * The default values for the parameters are deliberately low to reduce the
 * impact of running an analysis inadvertently and to provide a sensible
 * starting point for your investigations. Run your first analysis with the
 * default parameter values to check for simple problems. If successful, run a
 * sequence of increasingly large analyses until you encounter a failure or you
 * reach a <code>blob_count</code> of at least <code>2000</code>, a
 * <code>max_blob_size</code> of at least <code>2gb</code>, a
 * <code>max_total_data_size</code> of at least <code>1tb</code>, and a
 * <code>register_operation_count</code> of at least <code>100</code>. Always
 * specify a generous timeout, possibly <code>1h</code> or longer, to allow time
 * for each analysis to run to completion. Perform the analyses using a
 * multi-node cluster of a similar size to your production cluster so that it
 * can detect any problems that only arise when the repository is accessed by
 * many nodes at once.
 * <p>
 * If the analysis fails, Elasticsearch detected that your repository behaved
 * unexpectedly. This usually means you are using a third-party storage system
 * with an incorrect or incompatible implementation of the API it claims to
 * support. If so, this storage system is not suitable for use as a snapshot
 * repository. You will need to work with the supplier of your storage system to
 * address the incompatibilities that Elasticsearch detects.
 * <p>
 * If the analysis is successful, the API returns details of the testing
 * process, optionally including how long each operation took. You can use this
 * information to determine the performance of your storage system. If any
 * operation fails or returns an incorrect result, the API returns an error. If
 * the API returns an error, it may not have removed all the data it wrote to
 * the repository. The error will indicate the location of any leftover data and
 * this path is also recorded in the Elasticsearch logs. You should verify that
 * this location has been cleaned up correctly. If there is still leftover data
 * at the specified location, you should manually remove it.
 * <p>
 * If the connection from your client to Elasticsearch is closed while the
 * client is waiting for the result of the analysis, the test is cancelled. Some
 * clients are configured to close their connection if no response is received
 * within a certain timeout. An analysis takes a long time to complete so you
 * might need to relax any such client-side timeouts. On cancellation the
 * analysis attempts to clean up the data it was writing, but it may not be able
 * to remove it all. The path to the leftover data is recorded in the
 * Elasticsearch logs. You should verify that this location has been cleaned up
 * correctly. If there is still leftover data at the specified location, you
 * should manually remove it.
 * <p>
 * If the analysis is successful then it detected no incorrect behaviour, but
 * this does not mean that correct behaviour is guaranteed. The analysis
 * attempts to detect common bugs but it does not offer 100% coverage.
 * Additionally, it does not test the following:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Your repository must perform durable writes. Once a blob has been written
 * it must remain in place until it is deleted, even after a power loss or
 * similar disaster.</li>
 * <li>Your repository must not suffer from silent data corruption. Once a blob
 * has been written, its contents must remain unchanged until it is deliberately
 * modified or deleted.</li>
 * <li>Your repository must behave correctly even if connectivity from the
 * cluster is disrupted. Reads and writes may fail in this case, but they must
 * not return incorrect results.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * IMPORTANT: An analysis writes a substantial amount of data to your repository
 * and then reads it back again. This consumes bandwidth on the network between
 * the cluster and the repository, and storage space and I/O bandwidth on the
 * repository itself. You must ensure this load does not affect other users of
 * these systems. Analyses respect the repository settings
 * <code>max_snapshot_bytes_per_sec</code> and
 * <code>max_restore_bytes_per_sec</code> if available and the cluster setting
 * <code>indices.recovery.max_bytes_per_sec</code> which you can use to limit
 * the bandwidth they consume.
 * <p>
 * NOTE: This API is intended for exploratory use by humans. You should expect
 * the request parameters and the response format to vary in future versions.
 * <p>
 * NOTE: Different versions of Elasticsearch may perform different checks for
 * repository compatibility, with newer versions typically being stricter than
 * older ones. A storage system that passes repository analysis with one version
 * of Elasticsearch may fail with a different version. This indicates it behaves
 * incorrectly in ways that the former version did not detect. You must work
 * with the supplier of your storage system to address the incompatibilities
 * detected by the repository analysis API in any version of Elasticsearch.
 * <p>
 * NOTE: This API may not work correctly in a mixed-version cluster.
 * <p>
 * <em>Implementation details</em>
 * <p>
 * NOTE: This section of documentation describes how the repository analysis API
 * works in this version of Elasticsearch, but you should expect the
 * implementation to vary between versions. The request parameters and response
 * format depend on details of the implementation so may also be different in
 * newer versions.
 * <p>
 * The analysis comprises a number of blob-level tasks, as set by the
 * <code>blob_count</code> parameter and a number of compare-and-exchange
 * operations on linearizable registers, as set by the
 * <code>register_operation_count</code> parameter. These tasks are distributed
 * over the data and master-eligible nodes in the cluster for execution.
 * <p>
 * For most blob-level tasks, the executing node first writes a blob to the
 * repository and then instructs some of the other nodes in the cluster to
 * attempt to read the data it just wrote. The size of the blob is chosen
 * randomly, according to the <code>max_blob_size</code> and
 * <code>max_total_data_size</code> parameters. If any of these reads fails then
 * the repository does not implement the necessary read-after-write semantics
 * that Elasticsearch requires.
 * <p>
 * For some blob-level tasks, the executing node will instruct some of its peers
 * to attempt to read the data before the writing process completes. These reads
 * are permitted to fail, but must not return partial data. If any read returns
 * partial data then the repository does not implement the necessary atomicity
 * semantics that Elasticsearch requires.
 * <p>
 * For some blob-level tasks, the executing node will overwrite the blob while
 * its peers are reading it. In this case the data read may come from either the
 * original or the overwritten blob, but the read operation must not return
 * partial data or a mix of data from the two blobs. If any of these reads
 * returns partial data or a mix of the two blobs then the repository does not
 * implement the necessary atomicity semantics that Elasticsearch requires for
 * overwrites.
 * <p>
 * The executing node will use a variety of different methods to write the blob.
 * For instance, where applicable, it will use both single-part and multi-part
 * uploads. Similarly, the reading nodes will use a variety of different methods
 * to read the data back again. For instance they may read the entire blob from
 * start to end or may read only a subset of the data.
 * <p>
 * For some blob-level tasks, the executing node will cancel the write before it
 * is complete. In this case, it still instructs some of the other nodes in the
 * cluster to attempt to read the blob but all of these reads must fail to find
 * the blob.
 * <p>
 * Linearizable registers are special blobs that Elasticsearch manipulates using
 * an atomic compare-and-exchange operation. This operation ensures correct and
 * strongly-consistent behavior even when the blob is accessed by multiple nodes
 * at the same time. The detailed implementation of the compare-and-exchange
 * operation on linearizable registers varies by repository type. Repository
 * analysis verifies that that uncontended compare-and-exchange operations on a
 * linearizable register blob always succeed. Repository analysis also verifies
 * that contended operations either succeed or report the contention but do not
 * return incorrect results. If an operation fails due to contention,
 * Elasticsearch retries the operation until it succeeds. Most of the
 * compare-and-exchange operations performed by repository analysis atomically
 * increment a counter which is represented as an 8-byte blob. Some operations
 * also verify the behavior on small blobs with sizes other than 8 bytes.
