	 * Simulate data ingestion. Run ingest pipelines against a set of provided

	 * <p>
	 * This API is meant to be used for troubleshooting or pipeline development, as
	 * it does not actually index any data into Elasticsearch.
	 * <p>
	 * The API runs the default and final pipeline for that index against a set of
	 * documents provided in the body of the request. If a pipeline contains a
	 * reroute processor, it follows that reroute processor to the new index,
	 * running that index's pipelines as well the same way that a non-simulated
	 * ingest would. No data is indexed into Elasticsearch. Instead, the transformed
	 * document is returned, along with the list of pipelines that have been run and
	 * the name of the index where the document would have been indexed if this were
	 * not a simulation. The transformed document is validated against the mappings
	 * that would apply to this index, and any validation error is reported in the
	 * result.
	 * <p>
	 * This API differs from the simulate pipeline API in that you specify a single
	 * pipeline for that API, and it runs only that one pipeline. The simulate
	 * pipeline API is more useful for developing a single pipeline, while the
	 * simulate ingest API is more useful for troubleshooting the interaction of the
	 * various pipelines that get applied when ingesting into an index.
	 * <p>
	 * By default, the pipeline definitions that are currently in the system are
	 * used. However, you can supply substitute pipeline definitions in the body of
	 * the request. These will be used in place of the pipeline definitions that are
	 * already in the system. This can be used to replace existing pipeline
	 * definitions or to create new ones. The pipeline substitutions are used only
	 * within this request.
