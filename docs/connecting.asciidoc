The code snippet below shows how to initialize a low level REST client and the 
Jackson object mapper to configure an ElasticsearchClient:

```
// Create the low-level client
RestClient restClient = RestClient.builder(new HttpHost("localhost", 9200)).build();

// Create the transport that provides JSON and http services to API clients
Transport transport = new RestClientTransport(restClient, new JacksonJsonpMapper());

// And create our API client
ElasticsearchClient client = new ElasticsearchClient(transport);
```

Authentication is managed by the 
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-rest/current/java-rest-low.html[low-level Rest Client].
For further details on configuring authentication, refer to the 
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-rest/current/_basic_authentication.html[documentation].
