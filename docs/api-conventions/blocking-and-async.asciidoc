=== Blocking and asynchronous clients

API clients come in two flavors: blocking and asynchronous. All methods on
asynchronous clients return a standard `CompletableFuture`.

Both flavors can be used at the same time depending on your needs, sharing the
same transport object:

["source","java"]
--------------------------------------------------
ElasticsearchTransport transport = ...

include-tagged::{doc-tests-src}/api_conventions/ApiConventionsTest.java[blocking-and-async]
--------------------------------------------------

Although we won't go in deeper details on asynchronous programming in Java, remember to handle failures of asynchronous tasks. It's easy to overlook them and have errors go unnoticed.
