=== Exceptions

Client methods can throw two kinds of exceptions:

* Requests that were received by the {es} server but that were rejected
(validation error, server internal timeout exceeded, etc) will produce an
`ElasticsearchException`. This exception contains details about the error,
provided by {es}.

* Requests that failed to reach the server (network error, server unavailable,
etc) will produce a `TransportException`. That exception's cause is the exception
thrown by the lower-level implementation. In the case of the `RestClientTransport`
it will be a `ResponseException` that contains the low level HTTP response.
