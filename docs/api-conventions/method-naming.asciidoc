=== Method naming conventions

Classes in the {java-client} contain two kinds of methods and properties:

* Methods and properties that are part of the API, such as
`ElasticsearchClient.search()` or `SearchResponse.maxScore()`. They are derived
from their respective names in the {es} JSON API using the standard Java
`camelCaseNaming` convention.

* Methods and properties that are part of the framework on which the Java API
Client is built, such as `Query._kind()`. These methods and properties are
prefixed with an underscore to both avoid any naming conflicts with API names,
and as an easy way to distinguish the API from the framework.
