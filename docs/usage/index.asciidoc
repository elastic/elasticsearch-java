== Using the Java API Client

The sections below provide tutorials on the most frequently used and some less obvious features of {es}.

For a full reference, see the {es-docs}/[Elasticsearch documentation] and in particular the {es-docs}/rest-apis.html[REST APIs] section. The {java-client} follows closely the JSON structures described there, using the <<api-conventions,Java API conventions>>.

If you're new to Elasticsearch, make sure also to read {es-docs}/getting-started.html[Elasticsearch's quick start] that provides a good introduction.
