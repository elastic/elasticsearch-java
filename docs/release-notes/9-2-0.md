# Elasticsearch Java Client 9.2.0 [elasticsearch-java-client-920]

Discover what changed in the 9.2.0 version of the Java client. 

## Breaking changes [elasticsearch-java-client-920-breaking-changes]

::::{dropdown} Map to NamedValue CompositeAggregation.sources  
`sources` in `CompositeAggregation` was wrongly mapped as `List<Map>`, but the server doesn't actually accept more than one value, so the type has been changed to `List<NamedValue>`.

**Action**<br> Change the builder to use the correct type.
Example:
- Old
    ```java
    esClient.search(s -> s
        .aggregations("agg", a -> a
            .composite(c -> c
                .sources(Map.of("source", CompositeAggregationSource.of(cas -> cas...))))
        )
    );
    ```
- New
    ```java
    esClient.search(s -> s
        .aggregations("agg", a -> a
            .composite(c -> c
                .sources(NamedValue.of("source", CompositeAggregationSource.of(cas -> cas...))))
        )
    );
    ```

::::{dropdown} String to Double GetOverallBucketsRequest.overallScore  
`overallScore` in `GetOverallBucketsRequest` was wrongly mapped as `String`, but the correct value to be sent to the server is `Double`, so the type has been changed to `Double`.

**Action**<br> Change the builder to use the correct type.
Example:
- Old
    ```java
    esClient.ml()
        .getOverallBuckets(b -> b
            .overallScore("2")
            ...
    );
    ```
- New
    ```java
    esClient.ml()
        .getOverallBuckets(b -> b
            .overallScore(2D)
            ...
    );
    ```
::::

::::{dropdown} Level to NodeStatsLevel NodesStatsRequest.level  
`level` in `NodesStatsRequest` was wrongly mapped as the `Level` enum, which did not match the values accepted by the server, so it has been replaced with `NodeStatsLevel`.

**Action**<br> Change the builder to use the correct enum.
Example:
- Old
    ```java
    esClient.nodes()
        .stats(s -> s
            .level(Level.Indices)
        );
    ```
- New
    ```java
    esClient.nodes()
        .stats(s -> s
            .level(NodeStatsLevel.Indices)
        );
    ```
::::

elasticsearch.streams.StreamsStatusRequest
masterTimeout: modified from elasticsearch._types.TimeUnit to elasticsearch._types.Time

::::{dropdown} TimeUnit to Time StreamsStatusRequest.masterTimeout  
`masterTimeout` in `StreamsStatusRequest` was wrongly mapped as `TimeUnit`, but the correct value to be sent to the server is `Time`, so the type has been changed to `Time`.

**Action**<br> Change the builder to use the correct type.
Example:
```java
esClient.streams()
    .status(s -> s
        .masterTimeout(Time.of(t -> t.time("10s")))
    );
```

## Features and enhancements [elasticsearch-java-client-920-features-enhancements]

::::{dropdown} Jackson 3 implementation of the JSON object mapper
Following the stable release of the Jackson library version 3, the Jackson 3 implementation of object mapper is now available!
The default implementation will stay version 2 for now, so to try the new implementation replace `JacksonJsonpMapper` with `Jackson3JsonpMapper`.
Example with shortcut builder:
```java
try (ElasticsearchClient client = ElasticsearchClient.of(e -> e
        .jsonMapper(new Jackson3JsonpMapper())
        .host("your-host")
        .apiKey("your-api-keys"))) {
        ...
}
```
