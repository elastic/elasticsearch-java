# Elasticsearch Java Client 9.1.0 [elasticsearch-java-client-910]

Discover what changed in the 9.1.0 version of the Java client. 

### Breaking changes [elasticsearch-java-client-910-breaking-changes]

::::{dropdown} Map to NamedValue Highlight.fields  
`fields` in `Highlight` was wrongly mapped as `List<Map>`, but the server doesn't actually accept more than one value, so the type has been changed to `List<NamedValue>`.

**Action**<br> Change the builder to use the correct type.
Example with `SearchRequest`:
- Old
    ```java
    esClient.search(s -> s
        .index("*")
        .highlight(h -> h
            .fields(Map.of("highlighter-field", HighlightField.of(hf -> hf...)))
        )
    ,Void.class);
    ```
- New
    ```java
    esClient.search(s -> s
        .index("*")
        .highlight(h -> h
            .fields(NamedValue.of("highlighter-field", HighlightField.of(hf -> hf...)))
        )
    ,Void.class);
    ```

::::{dropdown} Map to List<Map> WeightedTokensQuery.tokens  
`tokens` in `WeightedTokensQuery` was mapped as `Map`, but the server can actually accept more than one map, so the type has been changed to `List<Map>`.

**Action**<br> Nothing should be changed since the builders for List also accept a single value.

::::{dropdown} Class name change: IndicesBlockStatus -> AddIndicesBlockStatus in AddBlockResponse
`IndicesBlockStatus` was renamed to `AddIndicesBlockStatus` to avoid confusion with the new `RemoveIndicesBlockStatus`

**Action**<br> Replace the missing class with the new class name.

### Features and enhancements [elasticsearch-java-client-910-features-enhancements]

::::{dropdown} Opentelemetry update to stable conventions   
Following the stable release of Opentelemetry's database conventions, the client was updated to use the correct attribute names.

::::{dropdown} GetAliasResponse exception bug fix  
`GetAliasesResponse` is a special case because it can return both an exception and the actual response, in case 2 aliases, 1 present and 1 missing, are added to `GetAliasesRequest`. The java client was unable to parse the response and used to throw a `TransportException`, this was fixed by adding the additional alias information to the `metadata` field in `ErrorCause`:
```java
try{
    client.indices().getAlias(a -> a.name("test","test2"));
}
catch (ElasticsearchException e){
    Map<String, JsonData> metadata = e.error().metadata();
    JsonData index = metadata.get("example-index");
    Map aliases = index.to(Map.class);
    assertEquals("test", aliases.keySet().iterator().next());
}
```
