# Legacy REST Client [java-rest-low]

:::{include} /reference/_snippets/legacy-rest-client.md
:::

The low-level clientâ€™s features include:

* minimal dependencies
* load balancing across all available nodes
* failover in case of node failures and upon specific response codes
* failed connection penalization (whether a failed node is retried depends on how many consecutive times it failed; the more failed attempts the longer the client will wait before trying that same node again)
* persistent connections
* trace logging of requests and responses
* optional automatic [discovery of cluster nodes](sniffer/index.md)
