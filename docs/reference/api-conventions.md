# API conventions [api-conventions]

The Java API Client uses a very consistent code structure, using modern code patterns that make complex requests easier to write and complex responses easier to process. The sections below explain these in details.

* [Package structure and namespace clients](/reference/package-structure.md)
* [Method naming conventions](/reference/method-naming.md)
* [Blocking and asynchronous clients](/reference/blocking-async.md)
* [Building API objects](/reference/building-objects.md)
* [Lists and maps](/reference/lists-maps.md)
* [Variant types](/reference/variant-types.md)
* [Object life cycles and thread safety](/reference/object-lifecycles.md)
* [Creating API objects from JSON data](/reference/loading-json.md)
* [Exceptions](/reference/exception-conventions.md)
