# Java Low Level REST Client [java-rest-low]

The low-level clientâ€™s features include:

* minimal dependencies
* load balancing across all available nodes
* failover in case of node failures and upon specific response codes
* failed connection penalization (whether a failed node is retried depends on how many consecutive times it failed; the more failed attempts the longer the client will wait before trying that same node again)
* persistent connections
* trace logging of requests and responses
* optional automatic [discovery of cluster nodes](/reference/sniffer.md)
