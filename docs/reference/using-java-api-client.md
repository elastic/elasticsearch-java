# Using the Java API client [usage]

The sections below provide tutorials on the most frequently used and some less obvious features of {{es}}.

For a full reference, see the [Elasticsearch documentation](docs-content://get-started/index.md) and in particular the [REST APIs](elasticsearch://docs/reference/elasticsearch/rest-apis/index.md) section. The Java API Client follows closely the JSON structures described there, using the [Java API conventions](/reference/api-conventions.md).

If you’re new to Elasticsearch, make sure also to read [Elasticsearch’s quick start](docs-content://solutions/search/get-started.md) that provides a good introduction.

* [ES|QL in the Java client](/reference/esql.md)
* [Indexing single documents](/reference/indexing.md)
* [Bulk: indexing multiple documents](/reference/indexing-bulk.md)
* [Reading documents by id](/reference/reading.md)
* [Searching for documents](/reference/searching.md)
* [Aggregations](/reference/aggregations.md)

This is still a work in progress, more sections will be added in the near future.
