# API conventions [api-conventions]

The Java API Client uses a very consistent code structure, using modern code patterns that make complex requests easier to write and complex responses easier to process. The sections below explain these in details.

* [Package structure and namespace clients](package-structure.md)
* [Method naming conventions](method-naming.md)
* [Blocking and asynchronous clients](blocking-async.md)
* [Building API objects](building-objects.md)
* [Lists and maps](lists-maps.md)
* [Variant types](variant-types.md)
* [Object life cycles and thread safety](object-lifecycles.md)
* [Creating API objects from JSON data](loading-json.md)
* [Exceptions](exception-conventions.md)
