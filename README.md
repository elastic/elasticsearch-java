# Elasticsearch Java Client

The official Java client for [Elasticsearch](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch).

The Java client for Elasticsearch provides strongly typed requests and responses for all Elasticsearch APIs. It delegates protocol handling to an http client such as the [Elasticsearch Low Level REST client](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-api-client/current/java-rest-low.html) that takes care of all transport-level concerns (http connection establishment and pooling, retries, etc).

The `docs/design` folder contains records of the major decisions in the design of the API. Most notably:

- Object construction is based on the [builder pattern](https://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1216151).
- Nested objects can be constructed with builder lambdas, allowing for clean and expressive DSL-like code.
- Optional values are represented as `null` with `@Nullable` annotations instead of the newer  `Optional`, the Java ecosystem being still very null-based.
